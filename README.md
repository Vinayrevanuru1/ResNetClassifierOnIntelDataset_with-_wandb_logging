# ResNetClassifierOnIntelDataset_with-_wandb_logging
Here I try to implement Resnet  Classifier on Intel Data and log the training metrics in WandB


To run this   download intel imag dataset from kaggle an drun this notebook

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification




setup a wandb accoutn and get a api key , paste it when  needed



Here is an example of  analysing the results with the wandb table

I am really amazed by the features provided by wandb  to analyze our runs, the dashboards are pretty clean and interactive

Here are some more visualizations of Dynamic learning rates and Val losses

wandb also has the cpu and gpu usage statistics that  help us in figuring out the  requirements of hardware configuration
